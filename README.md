## Hello, I'm Tia Isnawati Noor üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a recent graduate in Computer Science with a passion for ensuring software quality and reliability. While I may be new to the world of Quality Assurance (QA), I'm eager to learn and grow in this field.

### üåü What I Bring to the Table

- **Solid Foundation in Computer Science:** My academic background has equipped me with a strong understanding of software development principles, algorithms, and data structures.

- **Attention to Detail:** I have a keen eye for spotting inconsistencies and a commitment to delivering error-free software.

- **Effective Communication:** I excel at explaining complex technical concepts in a clear and concise manner, which is crucial for collaborating with development teams.

- **Adaptability:** As a recent graduate, I'm open to new challenges and eager to embrace different technologies and methodologies in QA.

### üìö What I'm Learning

I'm currently focused on building my skills in:

- **Quality Assurance Introduction:** Gain a solid understanding of what Quality Assurance is and why it's crucial in software development.

- **Creating Test Scenario & Test Case:** Learn how to create effective test scenarios that cover various aspects of a software application, from user interactions to system integrations.
  
- **Manual Testing:** I'm diving into the fundamentals of manual testing to understand the QA process from the ground up.

- **API Automation:** Develop a structured approach to designing, executing, and managing API tests. Explore popular API automation tools like Postman, RestAssured, and more, and learn to work with them effectively.

- **Web Automation:** Learning how to automate web testing processes, including interaction with web elements, executing test cases, generating reports, and integrating automation into the software development lifecycle, to ensure the reliability and quality of web applications. 

- **Mobile Automation:** Learning how to automate mobile applications to efficiently test their functionality, usability, and performance across various mobile devices and platforms.

### üöÄ What's Next

I'm actively seeking opportunities to gain hands-on experience in QA and contribute to real-world projects. Whether it's finding and reporting bugs, improving testing processes, or collaborating with development teams, I'm ready to make a positive impact.
